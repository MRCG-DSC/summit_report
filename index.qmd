# Introduction

::: {.block}
<!-- ::: {.block fill="luma(230)" inset="8pt" radius="4pt"} -->

Powered by Data.org, the Epiverse-TRACE project has made substantial progress toward producing analytics tools aimed at addressing the most critical questions during epidemics. Currently, up to nine (9) Epiverse-TRACE packages are available on CRAN, with about twenty (20) more under active development. This reflects the results of two years of joint efforts between team members and our user communities.

Every year, the Epiverse-TRACE team members, along with invited stakeholders from WHO, Data.org, and various healthcare organizations, convene to discuss progress, evaluate deliverables, and plan future activities. The third Epiverse-TRACE annual summit will be held at the MRC Unit in Fajara, The Gambia from December 2 to 6, 2024, under the theme: Strengthening Sustainable and Inclusive Analytics Ecosystem for Epidemic Preparedness.

The organizing committees of this event, composed of members from the different Epiverse teams, have developed the summit’s program to ensure the success of the event. This includes a pre-summit training workshop scheduled to be held a week before the summit (25 - 29 November 2024). The training will be conducted by our team of Research Fellows (RFs), supported by Research Software Engineers (RSEs). Participants will learn how to use our tools within an outbreak analysis workflow.

## Openning Ceremony 

The third Epiverse Summit was held in Banjul from the 2nd to the 6th of December under the theme “Strengthening a Sustainable and Inclusive Analytics Ecosystem for Epidemic Preparedness”. This annual flagship event brought together 44 participants, including 6 members of the LSHTM, 4 members from Universidad Javeriana and Universidad de los Andes in Colombia, 6 members from the MRC Unit The Gambia, and 5 members of data.org.
The discussions during the welcome ceremony at the Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara International Conference Centre were centered around the importance of the Epiverse initiative and plans for its second phase. In his keynote address Dr. Ahmadou Lamin Samateh, the Honourable Minister of Health of The Gambia stated that “the development of analytics tools for pandemic preparedness and response is timely and essential.” He added that “the memories of the COVID-19 pandemic are still fresh, highlighting the need to be prepared for future pandemics with the right tools and processes”. According to Dr. Bubacarr Bah, Head of Data Science Cluster at MRCG at LSHTM and one of the Principal Investigator for the Epiverse-TRACE project, “this is a global initiative and it is about building open-source tools for analysis to transform the way we deliver data science for social good. Our main goal was to change how analytics tools are used in global infectious disease response, moving from ad-hoc approaches to integrated, generalisable and scalable community-driven software.” In their interventions, Uyi Stewart, Chief Data and Technology Officer and Maguette Ndong, Technical Program Manager at data.org provided details of the plans for the second phase of the project, while highlighting the important role of data.org in its implementation.
The afternoon sessions of the summit consisted in multiple discussions between the research software developers (RSEs) and research fellows (RFs) around topics that are important for the sustainability of the project and building a cohesive team. A summary of main outcomes from these panels can be found here.

### Designing Outbreak Analytics Course 

```{=typst}

Training is a cornerstone of the Epiverse-TRACE project, ensuring that our advanced analytics packages are recognized and adopted by a broader community. As the project enters its second phase, the focus shifts towards developing and delivering structured courses. Training within Epiverse-TRACE is facilitated through a variety of resources, including showcases, case-studies, how-to guides,  tutorials, and the Epi Training Kit (#link("https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epi-training-kit/index-EN.html")[EpiTkit]).

During the final day of the summit, participants shared insights on designing an in-person data-centered outbreak analytics course aimed at training and teaching outbreak analysis as well as on the translation and adaptation of the Epi Training Kit materials for  African context. The discussion also reflected on lessons learned from previous training sessions, identified existing gaps, and explored strategies to address them.
In this session, the training team presented the pre-summit training report along with its feedback (see #link("https://zenodo.org/records/14946723")[Pre-summit Training report]).

 We also discussed strategies for implementing training in the project's second phase, including the EpiTkit modules as part of comprehensive training in TRACE-LAC for Latin America and the LSHTM-MRCG plans for delivering training courses in Africa. 
The discussion centered on four key aspects of training: content, audience, cultural adaptation, and assessment. Participants, divided into five groups, responded to targeted questions within each aspect. Their insights were collected and summarized in the following table.
